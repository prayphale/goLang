**Gophercises**

In this repo there are 4 Different mini-applications, packages, and tools that are each designed to teach something different. </br>
Through the course I will learn about and practice using: </br>
Channels </br>
Functional Options </br>
Chaining Interfaces </br>
Various parts of the standard library (io, time, and many other packages) </br>
Reading input from the command line </br>
And much much more! </br>

**Build and Insatll Go Program**

1.go env GOPATH </br>
2. cd .. </br>
3. go install  </br>
4. ls $GOPATH/bin </br>
5. go build </br>
6. go run main.go </br>

**1. caeserCipher**

     Caesar cipher, involves encrypting a string using a fairly basic cipher where you are changing the ascii value of each character.
     
     Input:- Add any character or string in casar.in file and in the terminal just command "go run main.go < camel.in"
              e.g:- middle-OutzðŸ˜‰
              
     OutPut:- okffng-QwvbðŸ˜‰
     
     Note:- This change the ascii value only for charecter/string not for numbers, symbols etc.
     
**2. camelCase**              
       Camel Case goal is to find out how many words were used to create a camelcase string.
       
       Input:- Add any string with capital small and run "go run main.go < camel.in"
              e.g:- saveChangesInTheEditor
              
       Output:- index: 0 Run: 115 
                index: 1 Run: 97
                index: 2 Run: 118
                index: 3 Run: 101
                index: 4 Run: 67
                index: 5 Run: 104
                index: 6 Run: 97
                index: 7 Run: 110
                index: 8 Run: 103
                index: 9 Run: 101
                index: 10 Run: 115
                index: 11 Run: 73
                index: 12 Run: 110
                index: 13 Run: 84
                index: 14 Run: 104
                index: 15 Run: 101
                index: 16 Run: 69
                index: 17 Run: 100
                index: 18 Run: 105
                index: 19 Run: 116
                index: 20 Run: 111
                index: 21 Run: 114

   **3. quizGame**
            In this exercixe, will read in a quiz provided through a CSV file and will then give the quiz to keeping track of how many questions get right and how many get                   incorrect.
            
           The CSV file should default to **'problems.csv'** 
           The default time limit should be 30 seconds, but should also be customizable. Quiz should stop as soon as the time limit has exceeded. That is, you shouldnâ€™t wait for            the user to answer one final questions but should ideally stop the quiz entirely even if you are currently waiting on an answer from the end user.
           
           Output:- 
                Problem #1: 5+5 = 2
                Problem #2: 7+3 = 2
                Problem #3: 1+1 = 23
                Problem #4: 8+3 = 11
                Problem #5: 1+2 = 3
                Problem #6: 8+6 = 15
                Problem #7: 3+1 = 4
                Problem #8: 1+4 = 5
                Problem #9: 5+1 = 6
                Problem #10: 2+3 = 5
                Problem #11: 3+3 = 6
                Problem #12: 2+4 = 6
                Problem #13: 5+2 = 7

                Scored 9 out of 13.
                
   **4.urlShortener**            
        In urlShortener exercise, to create an http.Handler that will look at the path of any incoming web request and determine if it should redirect the user to a new                 page,much like URL shortener would.
        
        On command line run this "go run main/main.go" command and ou will see server will start on port e.g:- 8081.
